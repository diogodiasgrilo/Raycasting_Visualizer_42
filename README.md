![Raycasting](./sprites/raycaster.png)

I created this raycasting program as a base for the minimap of the Cub3d project which is part of the 42 Lisbon campus cursus.

Here is the proper way to execute the raycasting program:

"program name" "map file"

Here is a visual example of a command to input in the terminal:
```bash
âžœ  ~ ./raycasting ./maps/test.ber
```
You can move the square player around with the ASDW keys and the square will move in the direction that the rays are shooting towards, either left, right, up, or down.

The A and D keys will move the angle of the rays (the player's perspective).

The S and W keys will move the player forward and backward based on where the rays are pointed on the map.

Raycasting can be used to create 3D-looking games by assigning a rectangle of pixels on the screen to each ray cast, thus creating a different-sized rectangle based on how long each cast ray was. This will create the illusion of a 3D world with 2D objects. The next step for this raycaster is to start drawing rectangles on a split screen with the minimap or on a separate screen altogether!
Try using this raycasting program on different maps either from my maps folder or by making your own.
