![Raycasting](./sprites/raycaster.png)

Proper usage when executing the program:

"program name" "map file"

Visual example:
```bash
âžœ  ~ ./raycasting ./maps/test1.ber
```
You can move the square player around with the asdw keys and the square will move in the direction that the rays are shooting towards.

The a and d keys will move the angle of the rays (player's view).
