![Raycasting](./sprites/raycaster.png)

I created this raycasting program as a base program for the minimap system of the Cub3d project which is part of the 42 Lisbon campus cursus.

Here is the proper way to execute the raycasting program in the terminal:

"program name" "map file"

Here is a visual example of a command to input into the terminal to try out the raycasting program:
```bash
âžœ  ~ ./raycasting ./maps/test.ber
```
You can move the square player around with the ASDW keys and the square will move in the direction that the rays are pointed at, either left, right, up, or down.

The A and D keys will move the angle of the rays (the player's perspective).

The S and W keys will move the player forward and backward based on where the rays are pointed on the map.

Raycasting can be used to create 3D-looking games by assigning a rectangle of pixels of any color on the screen for each ray cast, thus creating a different-sized rectangle based on how long each cast ray was. This will create the illusion of a 3D world with 2D objects. The next step for this raycaster is to start drawing rectangles on the screen with the minimap somewhere else on the screen, maybe smaller in a corner.
You can try using this raycasting program on different maps either from my maps folder or by making your own.
