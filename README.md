![Raycasting](./sprites/raycaster.png)

Proper usage when executing the program:

"program name" "map file"

Visual example:
```bash
âžœ  ~ ./raycasting ./maps/test1.ber
```
You can move the square player around with the asdw keys and the square will move in the direction that the rays are shooting towards.

The a and d keys will move the angle of the rays (player's view).

The s and w keys will move the player forward and backwards based on where the rays are pointed to.

Raycasting can then be used to create 3D looking games by assigning a rectangle on the screen for each ray cast, thus creating a different sized rectangle based on how long each cast ray was. This will create the illusion of a 3D world with 2D objects. The next step for this raycaster is to start drawing rectangles on a split screen with the minimap or on a seperate screen altogether.

Try using this raycaster program on different maps either from my maps folder or make your own.
